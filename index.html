            Linear discrete-time Kalman filter simulation demo: object in free fall, no air resistance.
        </h1>

        <p>
            Continuous time kinematic equations for height of falling object: <br>
            <b>Velocity:</b> $\dot{h} = \dot{h}(t-\Delta t) - g \Delta t$, seen more frequently as <br>
            the kinematic equation $v = v_{0} + at$ <br>
            
            <b>Height (position):</b> $ h(t)= h(t-\Delta t) + \dot{h}(t-\Delta t)\Delta t - \frac{1}{2} g (\Delta t)^2$, seen<br>
            more frequently as the kinematic equation $x = x_{0} + v_{0}t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
            <br><br>
            Since we're running a predictor-corrector loop, we convert the continuous<br> equations to ones
            described in terms of a discrete time index,<br> $k$, where $t=k\Delta t$:
            <br>
            ${\dot{h}}_k = {\dot{h}}_{k-1}-g\Delta t$ <br>
            $h_k = h_{k-1} + {\dot{h}}_{k-1} \Delta t - \frac{1}{2}g (\Delta t)^2$<br>

            We're estimating the position, so position must be used as a state.<br>
            Since velocity appears in the position equation, we also include it as a state.<br><br>
            In this example, the input vector $u$ is defined to be $g$, the graviational constant.<br>
            $F$ (the state system matrix), $G$ (the input system matrix), and $u$ are all constant.<br>
            
            There is no process noise uncertainty term, $w$, since we assume<br>
            the Newtonian kinematic equations have little to no inherent error. Thus the process<br>
            noise covariance matrix, $Q$, can be set to zero for this problem.<br><br>

            Since we pretend the initial position of the object was guessed/determined roughly,<br>
            but the initial velocity is pretty much known to be 0, we use an error of $10 m^2$ for<br>
            the initial position and $0.01 \frac{m^2}{s^2}$ for the intial velocity.
